`go-alchemy-sdk` is a Go client library for interacting with the [Alchemy API](https://www.alchemy.com/) to access blockchain data and services. This library aims to provide a simple and efficient interface for developers building on top of Solana and other blockchains supported by Alchemy.

## Features

- **Solana Support**: Access Solana blockchain data with ease.
- **Customizable**: Configure client options, including API keys and rate limits.
- **Well-Documented**: Comprehensive documentation and examples.
- **Efficient**: Optimized for performance and minimal overhead.

## Installation

```bash
go get -u github.com/teyz/go-alchemy-sdk
```

## Quick Start

Hereâ€™s an example to get started with the `go-alchemy-sdk`:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	alchemy "github.com/teyz/go-alchemy-sdk"
)

func main() {
	// Create a new client with your Alchemy API key
	client, err := alchemy.NewClient("your-alchemy-api-key")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to create client: %v", err)
	}

	// Example: Get the balance
	balance, err := client.GetBalance("your-solana-address")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to get balance: %v", err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("Balance: %v\n", balance)
}
```
